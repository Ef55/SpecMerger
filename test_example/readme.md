# Test Example

This minimal example servers to illustrate how the tool can be used 

## How to run it

Just run `python3 test_example.py`

## What is it doing

This example is comparing a pseudo spec document in JSON with its implementation in python.
Both files are available in the [documents](https://github.com/epfl-systemf/SpecMerger/tree/main/test_example/documents) folder 
The script then allows you to either create a minimal text report or a full HTML report that you can view in your browser.

You can try to correct the mistakes from implem.py to have a report with no errors if you want to try it!

You can inspire yourself from the code to try to write a new small parser and have fun with the tool!
